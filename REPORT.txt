Abstract
Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short,
are an method to generative modeling using deep learning approach,
such as convolutional neural networks.

Recently, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have become one of 
the most popular topics in artificial intelligent field. Its 
outstanding capability of generating realistic samples not only 
revived the research of generative model, but also inspired the
 research of semi-supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a research 
focus of artiﬁcial intelligence. Inspired by two-player zero-sum game, 
GANs comprise a generator and a discriminator, both trained under the
 adversarial learning idea. The goal of GANs is to estimate the
 potential distribution of real data samples and generate new 
samples from that distribution. Since their initiation, GANs have
 been widely studied due to their enormous prospect for applications,
 including image and vision computing, speech and language processing,
 etc. In this review paper, we summarize the state of the art of GANs
 and look into the future. Firstly, we survey GANs’ proposal background,
 theoretic and implementation models, and application ﬁelds. Then, we
 discuss GANs’ advantages and disadvantages, and their development
 trends. In particular, we investigate the relation between GANs and
 parallel intelligence, with the conclusion that GANs have a great 
potential in parallel systems research in terms of virtual-real interaction
 and integration. Clearly, GANs can provide substantial algorithmic 
support for parallel intelligence.



INTRODUCTION:

Generative adversarial networks, or (G A Ns), are a very powerful 
type of neural network used for unsupervised machine learning process.
Made up of two rival(competing) models which run in competition with
one another, GANs are able to capture and copy variations 
within a dataset.

They’re great for image manipulation and generation, but they 
can also be deployed for tasks like understanding risk of disease,security and
recovery in healthcare and pharmacology.

Two neural networks fight with each other in a game
 to win(just like game theory)

GANs are actually pretty new – they were first introduced 
by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. Goodfellow developed them to
tackle some of the issues with similar neural networks, 
including the Boltzmann machine and autoencoders.

Both the Boltzmann machine and autoencoders use the Markov 
Decision Chain which has a pretty high computational cost. 
This efficiency gives engineers significant gains – which you 
need if you’re working at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.















conclusion;

GANs are relatively new and still require some research to reach their new
potential. In particular, training GANs requires finding Nash equilibria in 
highdimensional, continuous, non-convex games. Researchers should strive
 to develop better theoretical understanding and better training algorithms for this
scenario. Success on this front would improve many other applications, besides
GANs.
GANs are crucial to many different state of the art image generation and
manipulation systems, and have the potential to enable many other applications
in the future.
