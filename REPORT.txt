Abstract
Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short,
 are an method to generative modeling using deep learning approach,
 such as convolutional neural networks.




Generative adversarial networks( G A N ) is a category
 of deep learning in machine learning systems
 design by Ian Goodfellow with his partners in 2014.
Two neural networks fight with each other in a game
 to win(just like game theory)















conclusion;

GANs are relatively new and still require some research to reach their new
potential. In particular, training GANs requires finding Nash equilibria in 
highdimensional, continuous, non-convex games. Researchers should strive
 to develop better theoretical understanding and better training algorithms for this
scenario. Success on this front would improve many other applications, besides
GANs.
GANs are crucial to many different state of the art image generation and
manipulation systems, and have the potential to enable many other applications
in the future.
