## Abstract:

Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short,
are an method to generative modeling using deep learning approach,
such as convolutional neural networks.Recently, generative adversarial networks(GAN) 
have become one of the most popular topics in artificial intelligent field. Its 
outstanding capability of generating realistic samples.Inspired by two-player zero-sum game, 
GANs comprise a generator and a discriminator, both trained under the
adversarial learning idea. The goal of GANs is to estimate the
potential distribution of real data samples and generate new 
samples from that distribution. Since their initiation, GANs have
been widely studied due to their enormous prospect for applications,
including image and vision computing, speech and language processing,
etc.In this review paper, we summarize the state of the art of GANs
and look into the future.

 Firstly, we survey GANs’ proposal background,
 theoretic and implementation models, and application ﬁelds. Then, we
 discuss GANs’ advantages and disadvantages, and their development
 trends. In particular, we investigate the relation between GANs and
 parallel intelligence, with the conclusion that GANs have a great 
potential in parallel systems research in terms of virtual-real interaction
 and integration. Clearly, GANs can provide substantial algorithmic 
support for parallel intelligence.



### INTRODUCTION:

Generative adversarial networks, or (G A Ns), are a very powerful 
type of neural network used for unsupervised machine learning process.
Made up of two rival(competing) models which run in competition with
one another, GANs are able to capture and copy variations 
within a dataset.They’re great for image manipulation and generation, but they 
can also be deployed for tasks like understanding risk of disease,security and
recovery in healthcare and pharmacology.

Design by Ian Goodfellow with his partners in 2014.
Two neural networks fight with each other in a game
to win(just like game theory)


How do Generative Adversarial Networks work?

Let’s start with a simple analogy(likeness). 
You have a painting
 – say the Mona Lisa – and we have a master forger who
 wants to create a duplicate painting.
 The forger does this by learning 
how the original painter – Leonardo Da Vinci – produced the painting.

Meanwhile, you have an investigator trying to 
capture the forger and ‘second guess’ the rules 
the forger is learning.

To map this onto the architecture of a GAN, the forger 
is the generator network, which learns the distribution of 
classes while the investigator is the discriminator network, 
which learning the boundaries 
between those classes – the formal ‘shape’ of the dataset.

###  Applications of GANs

Generative adversarial networks are used for
a number of different applications.

Using GANs for Security

The rise of artificial intelligence has been wonderful for most industries. 
But there’s a real concern that has shadowed the entire AI revolution – cyber threats.
 Even deep neural networks are susceptible to being hacked.

A constant concern of industrial applications is that they should be robust 
to cyber attacks. There’s a lot of confidential information on the line! GANs 
are proving to be of immense help here, directly addressing the concern of “adversarial attacks”.

These adversarial attacks use a variety of techniques to fool deep learning 
architectures. GANs are used to make existing deep learning models more robust
 to these techniques. How? By creating more such fake examples and training 
the model to identify them. Pretty clever stuff.


GOOGLE BRAIN:

One of the best examples is a Google Brain
project back in 2016 – researchers used
GANs to develop a method of encryption.

This project used 3 neural networks – Alice, Bob, and Eve. 
Alice’s job was to send an encrypted message to Bob. 
Bob’s job was to decode that message, while Eve’s job
was to intercept it.

To begin with Alice’s messages were easily intercepted by Eve.
However, thanks to Eve’s adversarial work, Alice began to 
develop its own encryption strategy – it took 15,000 runs for
Alice to successfully encrypt a message that could be deciphered 
by Bob that Eve couldn’t intercept.

MEDICAL:

GANs are also being used in fields such as drug research.
The neural networks can be trained on the existing drugs Structures and suggest
new synthetic chemical structures that improve on drugs that already exist.

GANs for Image Editing:

Most image editing software these days don’t give us much flexibility to
 make creative changes in pictures. For example, let’s say you want to 
change the appearance of a 90-year-old person by changing his/her hairstyle.
 This can’t be done by the current image editing tools out there. 
But guess what? Using GANs, we can reconstruct images and attempt 
to change the appearance drastically.[1   ]

GANs for 3D Object Generation

It won’t surprise you to know GANs are quite popular in the gaming industry.
Game designers work countless hours recreating 3D avatars and backgrounds 
to give them a realistic feel. And let me assure you, it certainly takes a 
lot of effort to create 3D models by imagination. Does this seem unrealistic? 
Then I suggest you watch this video. You might believe the incredible power of GANs,
wherein they can be used to automate the entire process!









## CONCLUSION:

generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a research 
focus of artiﬁcial intelligence.
GANs are relatively new and still require some research to reach their new
potential. In particular, training GANs requires finding Nash equilibria in 
highdimensional, continuous, non-convex games. Researchers should strive
to develop better theoretical understanding and better training algorithms for this
scenario. Success on this front would improve many other applications, besides
GANs.

GANs are crucial to many different state of the art image generation and
manipulation systems, and have the potential to enable many other applications
in the future.

## Generative adversarial networks: the cutting edge of artificial intelligence

As we’ve seen, GANs offer some really exciting opportunities in artificial intelligence.
 There are two key advantages you need to remember: GANs solve the problem of 
generating data when you don’t have enough to begin with and they require no human supervision.

This is crucial when you think about the cutting edge of artificial intelligence,
 both in terms of the efficiency of running the models, and the real-world data 
we want to use – which could be poor quality or have privacy and confidentiality 
issues, as much healthcare data does.
